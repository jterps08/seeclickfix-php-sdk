#PHP SeeClickFix API - Alpha

This is a PHP 5.3+ API wrapper for the [SeeClickFix API](http://dev.seeclickfix.com/)

The API comes with a cURL client (`SeeClickFixSDK\Net\CurlClient`) to access the SeeClickFix API.  You can create your own client, it just has to implement `SeeClickFixSDK\Net\ClientInterface`.
